Introduction
---------------------------
This directory contains scripts that generate transactions with given mixed 
set of characteristics. This is based on an observation in [1]; the performance
behavior of certain TM applications can be explained by the mixture of TM Characteristics.
(For example, the performance difference of TL2/SwissTM version of genome application 
 was due to the mixture of short and long transactions.)
Here we provide a set of intersting mixture of TM characteristics, based on our experience

Scripts
---------------------------
The first four scripts (unfirom, gaussian, longtail, and bimodal) generate
various transcation lengths with specified distribution. 
The fifth script (reader_writer) generates a mixture of read-oriented and 
write-oriented transactions.
