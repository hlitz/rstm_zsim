Introduction
---------------------------
This directory contains scripts that we used for pathology generation in [1].

In [1], we hacked eager and lazy version of tl2 such that  time-stamp value 
at every (re-)start of the transaction is stored in the memory buffer; we
use these time-stamp values to create a visualized trace of pathology signatures.
In this package, however, we only provide EigenBench scripts without any 'hackings'
since out package do not include any STM implementation.

See [1] for details.

Note that, in [1], we only verified three parameter sets. FirendelyFire, StarvingEdler 
and RestartConvoy. Othe pathology parameters are, currently, conjectural. Please share 
your experience if you find better parameter sets for these pathology generation.
