Introduction
---------------------------
This directory contains scripts that we used for STAMP workload mimicry in [1].  The goal of workload mimicry is, however, to demonstarte the behavior of TM 
applications are governed by TM characteristics. Therefore we do not expect
users to investigate in finding EigenBench parameter sets that reproduce 
their own the application behavior, in general. Rather we expect the application
behavior is explained by the result of orthogonal analysis. 

See [1] for details.
